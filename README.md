# Serverless verify-code

This is an API to perform code verification by SMS.

## Usage



### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-verify-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev (196s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-verify-api-project-dev-api (766 kB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can verify one phone by calling the corresponding endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sms' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"phone": "+551122334455"}'
```

Which should result in the following response:

```bash
{"msg":"success"}
```

You can check a code by `code` by calling the following endpoint:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sms/:code
```

If you try to check code that does not exist, you should receive the following response:

```bash
{"error":"Could not find code"}
```
